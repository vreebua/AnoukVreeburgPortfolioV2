                <h2>Design and Programming</h2>
                <p>Simply put, I made a fun design for a website and decided to code it. This really helped me develop my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills.
                </p>

                <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
                <p>I did a big project for an Artificial Intelligence assignment. The goal of the assignment was mostly to learn about this upcoming technology, with the making of a product on the end. I made a website that helps the user pick a Netflix movie or show by reading their mood from their Twitter. I learned how to work with AI and how to accomplish the succes of my last sentence! I liked doing it a lot!

                <h2>Internet of Things</h2>
                <p>To connect a physical object to a digital solution a concept was born. I made an easel with a projector that is controllable by voice, so you can simply change the canvas when you are busy with painting. This method is fast, makes sure your painted nails don't stain other things and it is overall fun and easy!</p>
                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/anoukphotos/img.png" alt="" /></span>
                <h2>Virtual Reality</h2>
                <p>My first introduction with Virtual Reality was a real fun one! I came up with a concept that helps people with motionsickness that VR glasses can cause. I achieved this by first placing the user in a recognisable room, like a living room, before the real game starts. This way, the user will less hardly move into a hard fantasy VR world, by first adjusting the eyes through a fimiliar scene. All of this is also backed up by research!  </p>
                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/anoukphotos/img.png" alt="" /></span>
                <h2>Frontend</h2>
                <p>For a frontend class in my studies we had to create multiple websites that would showcase how well we could work with Javascript, jQuery and beyond. These were real fun exercises and helped me learn a lot more about programming. Important to note, CSS was not essential, what resulted in not the most looking websites.</p>
                <span class="image fit"><img src="images/anoukphotos/img.png" alt="" /></span>
                <h2>Project Sleep</h2>
                <p>For a school assignment I was put in a team of four to make a product that helps with going to sleep. Everyone had different roles for this project, whereas mine was the website maker. I had to show on the website all the benefits that the product entails. Iâ€™m proud of how the website ended up looking!
