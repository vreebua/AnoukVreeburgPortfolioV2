                <p>For my graduation project I had to solve a problem with a media outlet. The problem that I wanted to solve is the deficient cooking times of a student, I wanted to reduce fast unhealthy microwaves meals and to motivate the student to choose a healthy cooking meal. After a lot of research concept were born and ultimately one was executed. With this project I tried a different style, with visuals and UX, which luckily succeeded.
                    <br><br>
                    In the end I made a fun application that works with gamification to motivate the student to cook more. I achieve this by letting the user cook with help of challenges, showing of progression and to involve friends. All in all the product was a huge success!
                    <br><br>
