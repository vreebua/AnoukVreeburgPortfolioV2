                <h2>Notice Branded Media</h2>
                <p>I started my internship as UX Designer on the end of August in 2020 to February of 2021. During my internship I experienced different tasks like: A whole making of a new UX Design, researching, animations, Clips and sounds, Visual Design and much more. My main assignment was to make a better UX for their current product: The Company Locator. The Company Locator helps the user when entering a building, to show where their appointment is and how to get there. My task was to redesign the interface and remake the visuals. To complete this assignments I had to do a lot of research, make many concepts, get as much feedback as possible and testing it out. In the end, the product was a success!
