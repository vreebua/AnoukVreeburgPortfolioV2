                <h2>Dungeon Crawler</h2>
                <p>This game was made during the minor Applied Game Design in a team of four. In this team everyone had their own role, with mine being the developer.

                    The goal in the game is to free the princess by slaying the enemies in every coloured chamber. There are three coolers in total: blue, red and green. Every color has multiple chambers and a variety of enemies. At the end of each color is a key. When the three pieces of the keys are collected, the door to the princess opens.

                <h2>Knight game</h2>
                <p>This game was made during the minor Applied Game Design in a team of five people. In this team everyone had their own role, with mine being the head game designer. The target audience for the game is students from around twelve years old that are going to a history museum.

                    The goal in this game is to collect as much stuff as you can within a time limit. For example, in level 1, you enter a castle as a 3D knight, where you have to collect stuff like swords, horses, rope and more. That is, if you can find them all. When the time is over the user can create a story with the collected items. How more items you collect, how better the chances that you can make a good story. There are a total of 3 levels and with each level the story progresses. When you collect enough items to choose good stories decisions, you win. When you collect to few, you will have to start again.

                <h2>Board game</h2>
                <p>This board game was made during the minor Applied Game Design in a team of four people. We had only one week to come up with a concept, build the game and explanation book and to shoot a product video on it.

                    Our board game is a variant of the famous game Bomberman. Expect, with our board game, the players are not bomb holders, but famous film killers, like Jason Voorhees and Michael Meyers, walking in a dark forest. The goal of the game is to be the last one standing, you can achieve this by slashing other players, setting traps or use abilities. A die tells you what move you can make and how far you can walk.

                <h2>First game</h2>
                <p>This game was my first interaction with game building, from concepts to coding in Unity.

                    The game itself is not complete, but for a first entry, I am still very proud of it.

                    In this 2D Platformer game you are personage that seeks rare flowers in a dangerous cave for your lover. In this cave are monsters and slippery slides that could result in death. You have to jump right and accordingly to achieve the flowers and to prepare for the endboss.
